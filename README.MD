## Week 1 Tasks 
Focus on the `homework` directory for this week's tasks. You can modify everything in this directory, but avoid making changes to the `server` folder.
### Mandatory Tasks 
 
1. **Ensure All Links Are Functional:** 
  - Verify and fix any broken links across the entire website to ensure seamless navigation.
 
2. **Stylize the Home Page:**  
  - Follow the guidelines in `design.pdf` to style the home page. Apply the required CSS to match the specified design.
 
3. **Optimize Code with Components:** 
  - Create separate component files for the footer and header to avoid code duplication. Use JavaScript to dynamically insert these components into each page.
 
  - *Hint:* Use the `onload` property of the window and the `getElementFromFile` method as presented in the course.

### Optional Tasks 
 
1. Enhance the appearance of other pages: 
  - **Blogpost Page:**  Design the presentation page for a blog post.
 
  - **Search Page:**  Create a page where users can filter blog posts by searching.
 
  - **Contact Page:**  Design a simple contact page. Be creative and make these pages look appealing.

Have fun and let your creativity flow as you work on this project!
